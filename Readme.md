# Visualizing Offerings Data 

```
A simple web app built using ReactJS, MySQL, Express, and NodeJS TypeScript for visualizing offers data from companies. Data is visualized in the form of Table and a couple of charts.
```

## Overview:

```
This task is a single page web application that allows user to search for different offers and market data using the provided easy-to-use filters. Data is also displayed in the form of interactive charts.
```
## Tools and Technologies
#### 1. Frontend:
			ReactJS, MaterialUI, React Testing Library, Jest
#### 2. Backend:
			MySQL, TypeScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Prisma (ORM)

## Structure:
Both the frontend and backend are implemented under the same directory. The frontend, however, is placed under the "frontend" folder separately from the backend.

## To set up the app, clone the app in your local github or just download the zip folder.

## 1. Setting up the backend:
#### To install:
In the same directory, run:
```
$ npm install
```

#### To run:

```
$ npm run dev
```

#### To build (prod):

```
$ npm run build
```
**Note**: Make sure you are using the right command for removing the directory in the scripts.build in package.json. Currently, the 'rd' command has been set according to windows.
## 1. To set up the frontend

#### To install:

```
$cd frontend
$ npm install
```

#### To run:

```
$ npm start
```
#### To Test:
```
$ npm test
```
